aria-label=\"https://www.military-ranks.org/army\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.military-ranks.org/army\" target=\"_self\">US Army Ranks and Insignia</a>]Summary: Always communicate with your ASL / SL first. Never jump the Chain of Command. The Open Door Policy exists.Military organizations are strictly hierarchical. Aside from rank, a Service Member is subject to the hierarchy of their \"Chain of Command\".The \"Chain of Command\" is a strategy for:\ndistributing orders and information down the hierarchy : \"pushing out\" orders / information\norganizing information as it moves up the hierarchy : \"pushing up\" information\nThe fundamental idea is that you are a \"link\" in the chain that strictly communicates with the level above (your direct supervisor) and the level below (your direct direct subordinates, if any).A \"squad\" is a small team of soldiers.As a member of 3rd PLT / 3rd SQD your direct supervisors are the Assistant Squad Leader (ASL) and Squad Leader (SL). Unless explicitly assigned, there is no one below you in the hierarchy.The ASL and SL of the squad are directly responsible for the remaining squad members (you). As a member of the squad, you will most often receive orders from the ASL if not the SL.The orders you receive from the squad-level leadership were likely passed down from platoon-level leadership.A \"platoon\" is a collection of 2-4 squads.The direct supervisor of a SL is the Platoon Sergeant (PSG). This person is typically a high-ranking Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO).The PSG works closely with the Platoon Leader (PL) who is typically a (commissioned) Officer.The differences between NCOs and Officers are outside the scope of this article. Just know that Officers always outrank NCOs.If you have a question / issue / request, always go through the ASL. If they can't immediately field your inquiry, the ASL will talk with the SL. From there the SL might talk with the PSG and so on.When your SL sends your issue up the Chain of Command, that is called \"pushing up\" information. For example a 1003 form must be pushed up to the Commanding Officer of RSD for approval.As you move up the Chain of Command, the scope of responsibility at each level expands. A high-level leader doesn't need to know about the specifics of your particular issue. It is up to your direct leadership to distill the information to what is necessary.By going through the ASL &amp; SL, issues can be solved at the lowest level. Perhaps your problem is part of a larger trend that can be solved as a batch. Trust in your direct leadership to digest your situation and present it properly to higher levels of leadership if necessary.Conversely when information is sent down the Chain of Command, that is called \"pushing out\" information. For example if the SL receives a Fragmentary Order (FRAGO, basically a change of plans) from the PSG, the SL will push out the FRAGO to the squad.Don't do this.Let's say you know high-level leader X has the power to fix your particular issue, so you communicate with that leader directly to get it fixed -- you are wrong.This action undermines your direct leadership by keeping them in the dark about your situation. It also implies that you do not trust your direct leadership or believe them to be incompetent. It is disrespectful to \"go around\" leaders in your Chain of Command.Furthermore, the nitty-gritty of your particular situation is not the concern of high-level leaders and is likely a waste of their time.Whenever possible, address your issues at the lowest possible level (within our squad).Let's say an issue arises that can't be solved despite your best efforts using the Chain of Command. You always have the option to speak with a high-level leader by invoking their \"Open Door Policy\".<br>Per <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ncolcoe.army.mil/Portals/71/administration/eeo/ref/AR-600-20.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ncolcoe.army.mil/Portals/71/administration/eeo/ref/AR-600-20.pdf\" target=\"_self\">AR-600-20</a>, \"an open door policy allows members of the command to present facts, concerns, and problems of a personal or professional nature or other issues that the Soldier has been unable to resolve.\"I want to emphasize this policy is for issues that you have been \"unable to resolve\" by normal means. Maybe you feel that your direct leadership is cutting you off from the Chain of Command unfairly. Maybe the issue is directly related to their behavior such that you fear retaliation if you discussed it with them directly -- consider using the Open Door Policy to get help because the Chain of Command is now broken above you.Again, try to resolve problems at the lowest level. Trust your leadership.
