Insignia</a>]Summary: Always communicate with your ASL / SL first. Never jump the Chain of Command. The Open Door Policy exists.Military organizations are strictly hierarchical. Aside from rank, a Service Member is subject to the hierarchy of their \"Chain of Command\".The \"Chain of Command\" is a strategy for:\ndistributing orders and information down the hierarchy : \"pushing out\" orders / information\norganizing information as it moves up the hierarchy : \"pushing up\" information\nThe fundamental idea is that you are a \"link\" in the chain that strictly communicates with the level above (your direct supervisor) and the level below (your direct direct subordinates, if any).A \"squad\" is a small team of soldiers.As a member of 3rd PLT / 3rd SQD your direct supervisors are the Assistant Squad Leader (ASL) and Squad Leader (SL). Unless explicitly assigned, there is no one below you in the hierarchy.The ASL and SL of the squad are directly responsible for the remaining squad members (you). As a member of the squad, you will most often receive orders from the ASL if not the SL.The orders you receive from the squad-level leadership were likely passed down from platoon-level leadership.A \"platoon\" is a collection of 2-4 squads.The direct supervisor of a SL is the Platoon Sergeant (PSG). This person is typically a high-ranking Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO).The PSG works closely with the Platoon Leader (PL) who is typically a (commissioned) Officer.The differences between NCOs and Officers are outside the scope of this article. Just know that Officers always outrank NCOs.If you have a question / issue / request, always go through the ASL. If they can't immediately field your inquiry, the ASL will talk with the SL. From there the SL might talk with the PSG and so on.When your SL sends your issue up the Chain of Command, that is called \"pushing up\" information. For example a 1003 form must be pushed up to the Commanding Officer of RSD for approval.As you move up the Chain of Command, the scope of responsibility at each level expands. A high-level leader doesn't need to know about the specifics of your particular issue. It is up to your direct leadership to distill the information to what is necessary.By going through the ASL &amp; SL, issues can be solved at the lowest level. Perhaps your problem is part of a larger trend that can be solved as a batch. Trust in your direct leadership to digest your situation and present it properly to higher levels of leadership if necessary.Conversely when information is sent down the Chain of Command, that is called \"pushing out\" information. For example if the SL receives a Fragmentary Order (FRAGO, basically a change of plans) from the PSG, the SL will push out the FRAGO to the squad.Don't do this.Let's say you know high-level leader X has the power to fix your particular issue, so you communicate with that leader directly to get it fixed -- you are wrong.This action undermines your direct leadership by keeping them in the dark about your situation. It also implies that you do not trust your direct leadership or believe them to be incompetent. It is disrespectful to \"go around\" leaders in your Chain of Command.Furthermore, the nitty-gritty of your particular situation is not the concern of high-level leaders and is likely a waste of their time.Whenever possible, address your issues at the lowest possible level (within our squad).Let's say an issue arises that can't be solved despite your best efforts using the Chain of Command. You always have the option to speak with a high-level leader by invoking their \"Open Door Policy\".<br>Per <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ncolcoe.army.mil/Portals/71/administration/eeo/ref/AR-600-20.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ncolcoe.army.mil/Portals/71/administration/eeo/ref/AR-600-20.pdf\" target=\"_self\">AR-600-20</a>, \"an open door policy allows members of the command to present facts, concerns, and problems of a personal or professional nature or other issues that the Soldier has been unable to resolve.\"I want to emphasize this policy is for issues that you have been \"unable to resolve\" by normal means. Maybe you feel that your direct leadership is cutting you off from the Chain of Command unfairly. Maybe the issue is directly related to their behavior such that you fear retaliation if you discussed it with them directly -- consider using the Open Door Policy to get help because the Chain of Command is now broken above you.Again, try to resolve problems at the lowest level. Trust your leadership. Only after that fails should you consider using the Open Door Policy.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"Chain of Command Expectations","level":1,"id":"Chain_of_Command_Expectations_0"},{"heading":"Squad Leadership","level":2,"id":"Squad_Leadership_0"},{"heading":"Platoon Leadership","level":2,"id":"Platoon_Leadership_0"},{"heading":"Using the Chain of Command","level":2,"id":"Using_the_Chain_of_Command_0"},{"heading":"\"Jumping\" the Chain of Command","level":2,"id":"\"Jumping\"_the_Chain_of_Command_0"},{"heading":"Open Door Policy","level":2,"id":"Open_Door_Policy_0"}],"links":["military-knowledge/chain-of-command.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"military-knowledge/chain-of-command-expectations.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759544129658,"modifiedTime":1760079835680,"sourceSize":4836,"sourcePath":"military-knowledge/Chain of Command Expectations.md","exportPath":"military-knowledge/chain-of-command-expectations.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":10,"backlinks":["form-1003.html","onboarding-reading-list.html","index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"military-knowledge/drill-and-ceremony-basics.html":{"title":"Drill and Ceremony Basics","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-file\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M15 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7Z\"></path><path d=\"M14 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4\"></path></svg>","description":"Position of Attention\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8De7O691yjc\" target=\"_self\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8De7O691yjc</a>Parade Rest\nAt Ease\nRest<br>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://youtu.be/onGybrxXSIs?si=Bj7LLm9aeoPMTT0P\" target=\"_self\">https://youtu.be/onGybrxXSIs?si=Bj7LLm9aeoPMTT0P</a>These follow the format of:\nPreparatory Command - Command of ExecutionLeft - Face\nRight - Face\nAbout - Face<br>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0QP6_5Ky4Q\" target=\"_self\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0QP6_5Ky4Q</a>Column Left - March<br>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://youtu.be/emt8dzkU0l4?si=4OZ-5ydb9mvklQGR\" target=\"_self\">https://youtu.be/emt8dzkU0l4?si=4OZ-5ydb9mvklQGR</a> pivot on your right foot to turn left\n\"march\" should be called on the left foot step, allowing you one more step before you pivot on right step\nColumn Right - March<br>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://youtu.be/E-HHz0pk_xk?si=oeYiqz4MwMlglncp\" target=\"_self\">https://youtu.be/E-HHz0pk_xk?si=oeYiqz4MwMlglncp</a> pivot on your right foot to turn left\n\"march\" should be called on the right foot step, allowing you one more step before you pivot on left step\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"Drill and Ceremony Basics","level":1,"id":"Drill_and_Ceremony_Basics_0"},{"heading":"Positions","level":2,"id":"Positions_0"},{"heading":"Facing movements","level":2,"id":"Facing_movements_0"},{"heading":"Column Left / Right","level":2,"id":"Column_Left_/_Right_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"military-knowledge/drill-and-ceremony-basics.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759196985814,"modifiedTime":1759520956812,"sourceSize":837,"sourcePath":"military-knowledge/Drill and Ceremony Basics.md","exportPath":"military-knowledge/drill-and-ceremony-basics.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":11,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"rsd-info-links/arduous-pft-standard.html":{"title":"Arduous PFT Standard","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-file\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M15 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7Z\"></path><path d=\"M14 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4\"></path></svg>","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://stateguard.cmd.ca.gov/public/join-the-california-state-guard/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://stateguard.cmd.ca.gov/public/join-the-california-state-guard/\" target=\"_self\">Source</a>Especially for those under 30 years old, this is a tough PT test to pass.PUSH-UPS in 1 minute:\nMale &lt;

Via your Chain of Command the Platoon Leader (PL) will receive and either approve or deny your Form 1003 (box 8a.) In the case of a personal schedule conflict, this is when the PL will tack on a training assignment for you to complete as your substitute duty. Next the Commanding Officer (CO) will either authorize or reject the PL's approval. Once you have completed the substitute duty, your Form 1003 can be certified (Section III), likely by the Commanding Officer (CO).\nCertification requires evidence that the substitute duty was completed. Examples of evidence include a course certificate or a PERSTAT (if you were on paid orders).\nTo date (NOV2025) I have never gotten an approved / authorized / certified Form 1003 back. The above is my understanding of how the Form 1003 approval &amp; certification process is supposed to work.Typically \"no news is good news\" after submitting a Form 1003. When there's an issue it will get kicked back to you quickly.If you are adamant that you need a certified Form 1003 (for example to claim scholarship money), your ASL / SL can help you pursue that. A certified Form 1003 is your proof that you were absent from drill in a legitimate way.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"Form 1003","level":1,"id":"Form_1003_0"},{"heading":"Personal Event Conflict","level":3,"id":"Personal_Event_Conflict_0"},{"heading":"CSG Assignment as Substitute Duty","level":3,"id":"CSG_Assignment_as_Substitute_Duty_0"},{"heading":"Submission Instructions","level":2,"id":"Submission_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Form 1003 Approval","level":2,"id":"Form_1003_Approval_0"},{"heading":"Form 1003 Certification","level":2,"id":"Form_1003_Certification_0"},{"heading":"Disclaimer","level":2,"id":"Disclaimer_0"}],"links":["military-knowledge/chain-of-command-expectations.html#_0","military-knowledge/chain-of-command.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"form-1003.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1760049321893,"modifiedTime":1761457175783,"sourceSize":4231,"sourcePath":"Form 1003.md","exportPath":"form-1003.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":18,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"index.html":{"title":"Home","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-file\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M15 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7Z\"></path><path d=\"M14 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4\"></path></svg>","description":"Maintained by SPC Shoemaker, SL<img alt=\"third-plt-mock-patch.png\" src=\"assets/third-plt-mock-patch.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 140px; max-width: 100%;\">\nGo Diamondbacks!\nNext drill 14-16OCT\n<br>Start here: <a data-href=\"Onboarding Reading List\" href=\"onboarding-reading-list.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Onboarding Reading List</a>\n<br>Drill absence request: <a data-href=\"Form 1003\" href=\"form-1003.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Form 1003</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Battle Rhythm Archive\" href=\"battle-rhythms/battle-rhythm-archive.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle Rhythm Archive</a>\n<br><img alt=\"unit-patch.png\" src=\"assets/unit-patch.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 130px; max-width: 100%;\">\nOne team!
